# Welcome to AgentPlaybooks

We are thrilled to introduce **AgentPlaybooks**, the comprehensive platform designed to give your AI agents a portable, persistent identity and toolkit.

## The Problem: AI Fragmentation

Today, building an AI agent often means locking yourself into a specific ecosystem. You create custom GPTs with complex actions in OpenAI, or you build elaborate prompt chains in Claude Projects. But what happens when you want to switch models? Or when you want to run a local LLM? Usually, you have to start from scratch.

Your agent's "brain"—its memories, skills, and personality—is fragmented across different walled gardens.

## The Solution: A Universal Playbook

AgentPlaybooks solves this by decoupling your agent's configuration from the underlying model. We call this configuration a **Playbook**.

A Playbook is a portable file that contains:

- **Personas**: Who the agent is (system prompts, style).
- **Skills**: What the agent can do (reusable functions, API calls).
- **MCP Servers**: How the agent connects to the outside world (Model Context Protocol integrations).
- **Memory**: What the agent knows (persistent key-value storage).
- **Canvas**: Where the agent works (structured documents).

## Why Use AgentPlaybooks?

1.  **Platform Independence**: Take your agent from ChatGPT to Claude to a local Llama model without losing its capabilities.
2.  **Team Consistency**: Share a Playbook with your team so every employee's assistant follows the same rules and has access to the same tools.
3.  **Community Innovation**: Discover and remix skills and MCP servers from the community.
