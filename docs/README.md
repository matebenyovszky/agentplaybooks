## What is AgentPlaybooks?

AgentPlaybooks is a platform-independent memory and toolkit for AI agents. It provides:

- **Personas** - Reusable system prompts that work across any AI platform
- **Skills** - Structured capabilities in Anthropic skill format
- **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol configurations
- **Memory** - Persistent key-value storage accessible by AI agents
- **Multi-Format Export** - JSON, OpenAPI, MCP protocol, Markdown

## Why AgentPlaybooks?

When you use multiple AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, custom agents), you often need to:
- Re-create the same system prompts
- Re-configure the same tools and capabilities
- Lose context when switching platforms

AgentPlaybooks solves this by providing a central vault that any AI can access.
